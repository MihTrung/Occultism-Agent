    user's birth information ({topic}). Format: birth time, DD/MM/YYYY.

    fixed outcomes or guarantees.

translation_task:
  description: >
    Translate the provided English astrology report
    into {target_language}, with a strong emphasis on
    readability, engagement, and reader interest.

    The translation should be easy to follow and
    engaging for general readers, including those
    with no prior knowledge of astrology.

    While preserving the original meaning, intent,
    and structure, you should:
    - Emphasize key ideas that are likely to capture
      the reader’s attention.
    - Improve flow and rhythm to guide the reader
      smoothly through the text.
    - Break up long or dense passages into clearer,
      more digestible segments when appropriate.

    You may rephrase sentences and simplify abstract
    or technical language, as long as no new meaning,
    interpretation, or information is added.

    Do NOT introduce new insights, opinions, summaries,
    explanations, or cultural commentary. All emphasis
    must come solely from clearer wording and better
    presentation of the original content.

    The final result should feel natural, engaging,
    and accessible to native speakers of {target_language}.
  expected_output: >
    A complete translation of the original astrology
    report in {target_language} that preserves its
    meaning while clearly highlighting the most
    interesting and engaging ideas for non-expert readers.
